<h1>SUBTITLE FROM AUDIO</h1>



<H3>Description</H3>

</br>

<p>This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to automatically generate subtitles (closed captions) from an audio file using Python. It combines speech-to-text techniques with timestamp segmentation to create subtitle-like outputs. It leverages speech recognition techniques to transcribe spoken words from music, podcasts, or speech recordings into accurate, timestamped text.</p>

</br>



<h3>🔍 Project Highlights</h3>

</br>

<p>
🎧 Audio Input: Supports popular audio formats like MP3 and WAV.
  
🧠 ML-Powered Transcription: Uses pre-trained models or APIs (like Google Web Speech API or DeepSpeech) for accurate speech-to-text conversion.

🕒 Timestamped Subtitles: Automatically segments the transcribed text into subtitle-ready format with time codes (ideal for videos or karaoke).

🎵 Lyrics Extraction: Designed to extract and structure lyrics from song audio.

📁 Optional Export: Outputs transcriptions in plain text or SRT (SubRip Subtitle) format.</p>
